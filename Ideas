Ideas for Silverball II:


-On Level 97, the ball starts off in the top, and collects the bomb powerup in the bottom, and has to let it explode in front of the gate that is blocking the middle-left. The level will be shaped like a square "3"

-On the first level of a certain stage, it should introduce a powerup that makes the ball much heavier, and the level is called "Add a little extra weight to that!"

-It should be my first game to include level codes, such as "ticticboom" (level that introduces timer bombs), "pachipachiii", "aurevoir" (Level 99), "blitzkrieg" (level 1 of stage that introduces the speed boost powerup), "forestfire", "dracometeor", "nosoapradio" (level in stage with DST track), "eon", "zerobass", "tada", "moonblast" (9:46 PM 7/12/2016: "loliloli"), 5:50 PM 7/14/2016: "kneeson", 10:32 PM (7/18/2016: "downthehatch) and more

There will be some stages with powerups that will invert the controls (light blue)

7:38 PM 8/30/2016 Idea had since at least yesterday

After the final boss, it will result in a false ending, allowing the player to access Stage 0 (levels are negative numbers) to achieve the hero ending.

9:28 PM 12/4/2016:

Stage VII: "Into the Black Hole". White oval-shaped motion effects will quickly rush left to right, indicating that it is a fast level.
Stage X: Mist should surround the area. Walls appear as grey stone.

4:20 PM 12/6/2016: Stage VII has brief flashes when entering teleporters

5:21 PM 12/27/2016: Create a shareable level creator for Silverball II.

8:11 PM 5/1/2017: Create a purple powerup (inverts controls), and a white powerup (purifier: removes all powerups from the ball).

1:28 PM 3/16/2019: There may be gravity centers that pull the ball in or out.
