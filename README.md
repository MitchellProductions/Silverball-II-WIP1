# Silverball-II-WIP1
A game created using GameMaker Studio 1. It plays like Ball Revamped, and 10 levels per stage. Each stage may introduce a new mechanic. Each powerup is color-coded. One may shrink the ball, grow it, invert its gravity, or flip the playfield. Many levels have two layers for the ball to travel through as shown in the trailer. You need to go into the orange "shrink" icon to go down a layer, and the orange "grow" icon to go back up.
This repository is for editors to contribute new levels and other features, since I ran out of ideas and left the project sitting there for a few years. You'll need a copy of GameMaker Studio 1 to be able to contribute to this project.
# What to do
Upload screenshots of your levels for me to review them. Be sure to create new branches for yourselves to not conflict with the main files. I'm seriously new to using GitHub, and I don't know how to get around very much.
